## Introduction

Concurrency stress testing is designed to evaluate how the closure execution system handles high-concurrency scenarios, ensuring stability, thread safety, and performance under load.

## Objectives

1. Assess the ability to handle multiple concurrent execution contexts.
2. Validate thread safety when accessing and modifying shared resources.
3. Detect potential race conditions, deadlocks, or resource leaks.
4. Evaluate performance impact under concurrent load.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Concurrency Execution
- Multiple concurrent executions of closure functions with shared resources.

### Scenario 2: Isolated Execution Contexts
- Testing isolated contexts using concurrent goroutines.

### Scenario 3: Concurrent Global State Modification
- Multiple concurrent modifications to shared globals in script execution.

### Scenario 4: Stress Test with Large Data
- Executing closures with large data sets concurrently.

### Scenario 5: Error Handling Under Load
- Evaluating error handling in concurrent scenarios.

## Setup and Environment

- **Operating System**: macOS
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor
- **Memory**: Sufficient memory to handle large workloads
- **Tools**: Go, Tengo library

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Concurrent Increment
- Define a script with a simple increment function that modifies a global counter.
- Execute this function across multiple isolated contexts concurrently to test isolation and state management.

```go
// Sample test case
import (
    "sync"
    "testing"

    "github.com/d5/tengo/v2"
)

func TestConcurrentIncrement(t *testing.T) {
    script := tengo.NewScript([]byte(`
        counter := 0
        increment := func() {
            counter += 1
            return counter
        }
    `))

    compiled, err := script.Compile()
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
    compiled.Run()

    // Prepare for concurrent execution
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    const numRoutines = 10

    for i := 0; i < numRoutines; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            ctx := tengo.NewExecutionContext(compiled).WithIsolatedGlobals()
            incrementVar := compiled.Get("increment")
            incrementFn := incrementVar.Value().(*tengo.CompiledFunction)
            result, err := ctx.Call(incrementFn)
            if err != nil {
                t.Error(err)
            }
            _ = result
        }()
    }

    wg.Wait()
}
```

### Test Case 2: Complex Data Handling
- Evaluate the system's ability to process complex data types concurrently by manipulating large arrays or maps.

... (more test cases)

## Execution and Monitoring

- Use Go's testing framework to run test cases.
- Monitor CPU and memory usage, execution time, and throughput.
- Capture and log any errors or anomalies.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Thread Safety**: No race conditions or data races detected.
- **Performance**: Acceptable performance within the baseline limits.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without unexpected crashes or deadlocks.

## Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**: Resource contention, data races, synchronization issues.
- **Troubleshooting**: Use Go's race detector and profiling tools for diagnosis. Review error logs for debugging.

This plan will guide the implementation of concurrent stress tests, ensuring the Tengo closure execution is robust, scalable, and performant under high concurrency scenarios.
