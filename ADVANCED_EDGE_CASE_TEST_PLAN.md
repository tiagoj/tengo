# Advanced Edge Case Testing Plan for Closure-with-Globals Enhancement

## Overview

This document outlines the advanced edge case testing strategy for the Tengo closure-with-globals enhancement. The aim is to ensure robustness across all potential problematic scenarios.

## Areas of Focus

1. **Global Variable Shadowing**
   - Test scenarios where local variables in closures shadow global variables.

2. **Recursive Closures**
   - Handle cases where closures call themselves directly or indirectly.

3. **Deeply Nested Closures**
   - Evaluate performance and correctness for closures nested several layers deep.

4. **Interdependent Globals**
   - Ensure globals used in closures can interdepend without conflict or deadlock.

5. **State Persistence through Errors**
   - Verify that closures maintain state even when execution is interrupted by an error.

6. **High Load Execution with Resource Constraints**
   - Simulate high-load conditions with limited resources to test degradation.

7. **Dynamic Function Composition**
   - Test the creation and execution of functions within closures dynamically at runtime.

8. **Duplicate Closures in Loops**
   - Handle edge cases where identical closures are created and executed in loop constructs.

## Testing Plan

- **Setup**
  - Leverage existing test infrastructure for execution.
  - Use synthetic scripts that simulate the above edge cases.

- **Execution**
  - Each edge case should have a dedicated test function.
  - Test functions must be comprehensive and check all expected outcomes.

- **Tools**
  - Use the race detector and memory analysis tools to complement functional tests.

- **Validation**
  - Confirm that all tests pass without errors.
  - Validate results manually where algorithmic verification fails.

## Documentation

- Document test cases, scenarios, expected outcomes, and any discrepancies discovered.
- Collaborate with team members to review test results and refine tests as needed.

## Completion Criteria

- All edge case tests must pass successfully.
- Ensure no new issues are introduced by changes.
- Verify all test scenarios are extensively covered.
